# Client-Server-Interaction-Singleton-Pattern
Design Server-side code that opens a socket connection on the localhost. The port number for the server should be read
from the command line. The server-code should accept connections on the socket. Each connection should be handled
by a new thread. This ServerWorker thread should read the following from the socket: the client name and an integer
value. The server should check if the integer value is greater than a threshold "THRESHOLD". The "THRESHOLD"
value should be defined as a constant, 3, in the Server code. The client input could be in the following format, or any
other format that you choose:

< primeQuery>< clientName>Bill< /clientName>< isPrime>17< /isPrime>< /primeQuery>

The server side uses a class named CheckPrime with a method that determines if a given interger is prime.
The server should respond back to the client with either of these messages:

< primeQueryResponse>< intValue>17< /intValue>< isPrime>Yes< /isPrime>< /primeQueryResponse>

or

< primeQueryResponse>< intValue>3559< /intValue>< isPrime>No Idea!< /isPrime>< /primeQueryResponse>

or

< primeQueryResponse>< intValue>2< /intValue>< isPrime>Not Valid< /isPrime>< /primeQueryResponse>

[Note: You need not have whitespaces as shown above.]
The server side should define a class named, AllPrimeQueries, that has a data structure that stores all the client names
and values that were queries.
The server side should have a text-based menu that allows provides the following options:

[1] Client Name [print the name and query integer]

[2] All Client Queries [print all names and queries so far]

[3] Quit [quit the server]

The server side menu is just to view the requests that have been received so far. The CheckPrime class should have a
method to take an int parameter and return a String. The server menu does not ask the user to determine if the client
input is prime or not.

If a client sends multiple requests, then all the name-value pairs can be printed in this way

If the server quits, all connected clients should catch the exception and quit too.
Design Client-side code that opens a socket connection to a port and host. The port and host should be read from the
command line. The client should also be driven by a text-based menu for

[1] Set client name

[2] Enter number to query for prime

[3] What is the server response?

[4] Quit

Assume that the client will always use #1 before #2. It should be possible to keep using option #1 to change the client
name. When #2 is chosen, the latest client name should be used.
The server response on the prime number will be printed when the option #3 is chosen.
The PrimeDriver has the main function. It calls ClientDriver or ServerDriver depending on the command line
argument

Debug

Define a Singleton Debug class and design your own scheme for what to print for different debug values.

Some Design Considerations

Handle all exceptions.

Multi-threading code should be written correctly.

Separate out code appropriately into methods, one for each purpose.

Code Organization
Your directory structure should be the following:

---primeService

---README.txt

---src

---primeService

---build.xml

---driver

---PrimeDriver.java [the main function is here]

---client

---ClientDriver.java

---ClientMenu.java

---server

---ServerDriver.java

---AllPrimeQueries.java

---ServerMenu.java

---socket

---PrimeServerSocket.java

---PrimeServerWorker.java

---PrimeClientSocket.java

---PrimeClientWorker.java

---util

---CheckPrime.java
